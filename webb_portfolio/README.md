# Personal Portfolio for D276: Web Development Foundations

This project is a personal portfolio website created from scratch for the Western Governors University (WGU) course D276: Web Development Foundations. It demonstrates foundational skills in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to build a clean, multi-page static website.

## Project Overview

The website serves as a professional portfolio and includes the following pages:

- **Résumé:** A page dedicated to showcasing a professional résumé.
- **Cover Letter:** A page containing a cover letter.
- **Career Goals:** A page that outlines career aspirations, and features a contact form and embedded media (audio and video).

## Features

- **Semantic HTML5:** The project is built using modern, semantic HTML5 tags for better structure and accessibility.
- **External CSS:** A single stylesheet (`master.css`) is used to ensure a consistent design and layout across all pages.
- **Contact Form:** The "Career Goals" page includes a functional HTML form that allows visitors to get in touch.
- **Embedded Media:** The site demonstrates the use of `<audio>` and `<video>` tags to embed multimedia content.
- **Multi-Page Structure:** The portfolio is organized into separate HTML files, linked together with a navigation menu for easy browsing.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**

## How to View the Project
